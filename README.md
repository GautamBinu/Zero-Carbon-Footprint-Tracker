## Zero Carbon Footprint Tracker

A Java-based command-line application designed to track and calculate carbon emissions across multiple categories for different users. This tool helps organizations and individuals monitor their environmental impact by tracking emissions from energy consumption, food choices, and transportation.

## 📋 Overview
The Zero Carbon Footprint Tracker provides a structured approach to measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions across three key areas:

Energy Consumption: Track emissions from different energy sources (Grid, Solar, Wind)
Food Choices: Calculate emissions based on meal types (Vegan, Vegetarian, Poultry, Beef)
Transportation: Monitor emissions from various vehicle types (Car, Bus, Train, Cycle)

## 🌟 Features

Multi-User Support: Track emissions for multiple users simultaneously
Category-Based Tracking: Organize emissions by Energy, Food, and Transportation
Flexible Emission Calculation: Each category uses specific emission factors based on real-world data
Daily Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports showing per-user and total emissions
User-Specific Analytics: Calculate total emissions for individual users
Exception Handling: Robust error management for invalid inputs
